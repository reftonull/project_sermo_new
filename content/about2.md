## The Basics

Hi there! I'm Laksh Chakraborty, an undergraduate student at New York University. I am a Computer Science major, and when I began this development on Project Sermo (far too long ago), I expected much of my activity on it to be related, in some way to Computer Science. I have since changed in that conviction. Project Sermo is likely, now, to be whatever inspiration strikes me.  That will, no doubt, include things in Computer Science, but might also include my other interests: history, the classics, TTRPGs, and more.

Project Sermo does, however, serve another purpose: to act as a place for me to store my thoughts. The thoughts of current me; so I may, at some point, look back on where I am today. With that quaint and somewhat clich√©d thought in mind, I hope you enjoy reading!

## The Site
When I first thought of starting a blog, I began, as every developer does, by thinking of a cool new CMS I could use. This was, as every developer then realizes, a very bad idea. The time commitment in making the actual CMS should not be secondary to the actual objective of the project. Yet, naive me was very excited about this whole thing, so he decided to make it all in [Vue], and in the process, learn [Nuxt.js]. Surprisingly, this actually turned out quite well, and much of the current design of the site was done in less than a week! And... then it sat there for months, waiting for me to actually get around to writing stuff.

Writing is easy, I had thought, but I vastly underestimated my fear of the blank page. I also didn't know how much time anything would take, which is a skill I haven't gotten much better at. (Here's the relevant [xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/estimating\_time.png))

All that aside, though, here are some technical details about this site. As I mentioned above, it is all made with [Vue], and more specifically, the [Nuxt.js] framework. It is a static site (this was important; I didn't really want to have to run a backend), and is all generated using Nuxt's (remarkably good) static site features.

All the content is stored as [markdown] files (even the stuff on the library page), and the raw markdown can be accessed simply by appending `.md` to the end of the URL. For example, [this]() is the raw markdown for the about page.

You can grab a permalink to any article by hitting the little <IconsCopyIcon></IconsCopyIcon> on every page. There is also an article outline, to help you get to where you want to go.
