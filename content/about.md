## Short Version
I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science. I enjoy hacking, teaching and puzzle solving. 

## Long Version

Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at New York University. I'm majoring in Computer Science, and my interest in the field is (at this point) very varied. I have dabbled briefly in many disciplines, including back-end web development, cryptography and machine learning, but the majority of my experience is in front-end web and app development. Most of this I did in my own time, and my overall aim at college is to formalize this "dabbling". 

College has given me the opportunity and time to branch out into other interests; I've learned about everything from Egypt in the late BCEs to analysis of photographs from the Second World War. All of this is circumscribed by my passion for learning; More than anything, I'm an puzzle solver: trying to make disparate things in disparate fields fit together to give a meaningful result. 

This exploration led me to discover my enthusiasm for teaching. I currently work as a Learning Assistant at NYU's University Learning Center, where I tutor classes in computer science, math, and even writing.
